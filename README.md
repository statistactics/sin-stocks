# Important Note Before Running the Code
- The code is dependent on Stock_Universe.csv to filter for relevant sin and stimulant stocks using NAICS and SIC codes.
    - Please see Instructions.docx (Step 3 in particular) for details on how to retrieve the data from Compustat using WRDS. Thank you, Tilden!

# Hypotheses
1. Sin stocks exhibit a counter-cyclical pattern of returns relative to the business cycle. 
2. Stimulant stocks exhibit a pro-cyclical pattern of returns relative to the business cycle.
